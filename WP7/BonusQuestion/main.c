/*
This program computes the Fibonacci number using an iterative method
instead of a recursive and stores the numbers in a linked list.
First it validates that the user has Ã¥rovided exactly one valid positive
integer, then it initializes the linked lsit with the first fibonacci numbers.
It then computes the finonacci numbers by summing the values of
the two most recent nodes. After creating x nodes the program prints
the value of the Fibonacci number which is stored in the last node.
Finally the program frees all the dynamically allocated memory used
in the linked list.
